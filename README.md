# Scrooge

Scrooge is yet another expense tracker app for Android

## Implemented features
These are the key features that are already implemented.

* Transactions can be tracked for multiple different accounts.
* Transaction tags: Each transaction can have multiple tags.
* Summary of spending/income can be viewed per account per tag within selected time span.
* Data can be exported and imported as XML.

## About the source files
All the required files for succesfully building the app should be available in this repo. I have been targeting API level 17 but even lower API level than that should suffice.
