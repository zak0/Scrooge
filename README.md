# Scrooge

Scrooge is yet another expense tracker app for Android

## About the project
This project is currently not actively under development. I decided to upload it here mainly for demonstration and archiving purposes. The app itself contains the "main" set of features that I planned it to have. I originally made this for my personal use to track my cash flow. It was good enough for me to use daily, but it definitely still has buttons that do nothing and annoying bugs.

Maybe someday I will jump ship back from iOS to Android and also continue with this project. :)

## Implemented features
These are the key features that are already implemented.

* Transactions can be tracked for multiple different accounts.
* Transaction tags: Each transaction can have multiple tags.
* Summary of spending/income can be viewed per account per tag within selected time span.
* Data can be exported and imported as XML.

## About the source files
All the required files for succesfully building the app should be available in this repo. I have been targeting API level 17 but even lower API level than that should suffice.

## Screenshots
See the screenshots folder in the repo for more pictures. Below is how the app looks like after startup.
